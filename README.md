### macOS

Install [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) via `brew install watchman` or fswatch via `brew install fswatch` to avoid [this issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/871) which occurs if your macOS has no appropriate file watching service installed.

`yarn install`

`yarn start`

Build production: `yarn build`
